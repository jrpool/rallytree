        <p>Do you need to operate on a tree of <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/software/agile-development/rally-software">Rally</a> work items?</p>
        <p>To do that manually, you must</p>
        <ol>
          <li>expand each work item in the Rally web interface, until the entire tree is expanded</li>
          <li>perform a bulk edit</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That can take you several minutes. It is also vulnerable to error.</p>
        <p>RallyTree <strong>automates</strong> that process. You specify the <strong>root</strong> user story of the tree and what you want  done. Then RallyTree performs the operation on that user story <strong>and all</strong> of its descendant user stories and tasks.</p>

        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <p>RallyTree can perform these operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Test-result acquisition: returning a tally of test-case verdicts</li>
          <li>Ownership change: ensuring all user stories and tasks have a specified owner</li>
          <li>Task creation: creating tasks with specified names for each test-level user story</li>
          <li>Test-case creation: creating a test case for each test-level user story</li>
          <li>Copy creation: copying a tree of user stories</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Trees</h2>

        </p>
        <p>Do you need to operate on a tree of <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/software/agile-development/rally-software">Rally</a> work items?</p>
        <p>To do that manually, you must</p>
        <ol>
          <li>expand each work item in the Rally web interface, until the entire tree is expanded</li>
          <li>perform a bulk edit</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That can take you several minutes. It is also vulnerable to error.</p>
        <p>RallyTree <strong>automates</strong> that process. You specify the <strong>root</strong> user story of the tree and what you want  done. Then RallyTree performs the operation on that user story <strong>and all</strong> of its descendant user stories and tasks.</p>

        <h2>Ownership change</h2>
        <p>One operation is to change the owner. If you request that, RallyTree examines all the work items in the tree. Wherever the specified owner is not yet the owner, RallyTree makes the change.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Test-case creation</h2>
        <p>Another operation is to create test cases. If you request that, RallyTree examines each test-level user story in the tree. If it has a test-case creation task but does not have a test case fulfilling that task, RallyTree creates that test case.</p>

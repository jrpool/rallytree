        </p>
        <p>Do you need to operate on a tree of <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/software/agile-development/rally-software">Rally</a> work items?</p>
        <p>To do that manually, you must</p>
        <ol>
          <li>expand each work item in the Rally web interface, until the entire tree is expanded</li>
          <li>perform a bulk edit (if possible) or an item-by-item count</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Trees of Rally work items can have hundreds of nodes. One operation can take about 15 minutes. It is also vulnerable to error.</p>
        <p>RallyTree <strong>automates</strong> that process. You specify the <strong>root</strong> user story of the tree and what you want  done. Then RallyTree performs the operation on the tree.</p>

        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <p>RallyTree can perform these operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Copy</strong> creation: copying a tree of user stories</li>
          <li><strong>Verdict</strong> acquisition: returning a tally of test-case verdicts and defects</li>
          <li><strong>Ownership</strong> change: ensuring all user stories, tasks, and test cases have a specified owner</li>
          <li><strong>Project</strong> change: ensuring all user stories, tasks, and test cases belong to a specified project</li>
          <li><strong>Scheduling</strong>: assigning a release and iteration, and optionally a schedule state, to schedulable user stories</li>
          <li><strong>Task</strong> creation: creating tasks with specified names for each test-level user story</li>
          <li><strong>Test-case</strong> creation: creating a test case for each test-level user story</li>
          <li><strong>Pass</strong> creation: creating a passing result for each test case that has an owner and has no result</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: representing a tree of user stories as JSON</li>
        </ul>

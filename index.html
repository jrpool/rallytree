      <section>
        <h2>Trees</h2>
        <p class="major">Do you need to operate on a tree of Rally work items?</p>
        <p>To do that manually, you must expand each work item in the Rally web interface, until the entire tree is expanded, and then perform a bulk edit. That can take you several minutes. It is also vulnerable to error.</p>
        <p>RallyTree automates that process. You specify the <span class="major">root</span> user story of the tree and what you want  done. Then RallyTree performs the operation on that user story <span class="major">and all</span> of its descendant user stories and tasks.</p>
        <p class="last">Problems? Please send questions or comments about RallyTree to <a href="mailto:jonathan.pool@cvshealth.com">Jonathan Pool</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Ownership change</h2>
        <p>One operation is to change the owner. You specify the new owner. Then RallyTree examines all the work items in the tree. Wherever the specified owner is not yet the owner, RallyTree makes the change.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Test-case creation</h2>
        <p>Another operation is to create test cases. If you request that, RallyTree examines each test-level user story in the tree. If it has a test-case creation task but does not have a test case fulfilling that task, RallyTree creates that test case.</p>

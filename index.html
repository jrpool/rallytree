        <h2>Trees</h2>
        <p class="rfloat">

        </p>
        <p>Do you need to operate on a tree of <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/software/agile-development/rally-software">Rally</a> work items?</p>
        <p>To do that manually, you must</p>
        <ol>
          <li>expand each work item in the Rally web interface, until the entire tree is expanded</li>
          <li>perform a bulk edit</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That can take you several minutes. It is also vulnerable to error.</p>
        <p>RallyTree <strong>automates</strong> that process. You specify the <strong>root</strong> user story of the tree and what you want  done. Then RallyTree performs the operation on that user story <strong>and all</strong> of its descendant user stories and tasks.</p>

        <h2>Operations</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Ownership change</h3>
          <p>One operation is to change the owner. If you request that, RallyTree examines all the user stories and tasks in the tree. Wherever the specified owner is not yet the owner, RallyTree makes the change.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Task creation</h3>
          <p>Another operation is to create tasks. If you request that, RallyTree examines each user story in the tree. If it has no child user stories, RallyTree creates tasks for it, named as you specify.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Test-case creation</h3>
          <p>Another operation is to create test cases. If you request that, RallyTree examines each user story in the tree. If it has no child user stories, RallyTree creates a test case for it.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Copy creation</h3>
          <p>Another operation is to copy the tree. If you request that, RallyTree creates a duplicate tree and gives it the parent user story that you specify. The copy includes only user stories.</p>
